# Chess Game

A fully interactive chess game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It features a drag-and-drop interface, move history tracking, and captured pieces display.  
Players can make moves manually or by typing chess notation (e.g. "pawn E2–E4").  

The game dynamically updates turn indicators, allows exporting and importing move history,  
and highlights selected squares for better visibility.
